## **Overview**

The Marble Maze project is a 3D game where players control a marble to navigate through a challenging maze. The objective is to reach the goal as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins for extra points. This project is designed to demonstrate physics-based gameplay, intuitive controls, and dynamic level design.

## **Game Play**
- **Player Movement**:
  - The player uses the arrow keys to control the board and move the ball.
  
- **Challenging Maze Design**:
  - Intricate paths, walls, and obstacles make the game engaging and fun.

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Coins to collect for bonus points.
  - Obstacles like moving platforms or rotating hazards.
  
- **Dynamic Scoring System**:
  - Collect coins to increase your score.
  - Display score dynamically on the UI across scenes.

- **Timer Mechanic**:
  - Tracks how long it takes to complete the maze.

- **Multi-Level Support**:
  - Easily add new levels with unique designs and challenges.
